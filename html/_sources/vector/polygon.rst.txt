Polygon shapefiles
==================

Let's now consider the polygons layers: in particular we will need the :file:`buildings`, :file:`landuse_a`, :file:`pois_a`, :file:`pofw_a` 
and :file:`water_a` layers, so you can hide all the others in the map.

#. **Merge vector layers**

    The Merge vector layers function, available at *Processing Toolbox->Vector General->Merge vector layers*, provides an algorithm that 
    combines multiple vector layers of the same geometry type into a single one. If the attributes tables are different, the attribute 
    table of the resulting layer will contain the attributes from all input layers. New attributes will be added for the original layer 
    name and source. We will use it to combine the :file:`landuse_a` and the :file:`water_a` in order to get a general layer describing both 
    land and water features. To do so, the input parameters are:

    + *Input layers*: click on the icon on the left and select :file:`landuse_a` and :file:`water_a`
    + *Destination CRS*: select the Project CRS, that should be :guilabel:`EPSG:32652 - WGS84 / UTM zone 52N`
    + *Merged*: the path and the name of the output vector layer. Note that if left empty a temporary layer will be created

        Merge function window

    As you can see this operation creates a new vector that contains features from both the landuse and water bodies layers:
