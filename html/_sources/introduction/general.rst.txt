============

The OSGeo UN Committee promotes the development and use of open source software that meets UN needs and supports the aims of the UN. 
Following a meeting between OSGeo Board of Directors and the UN GIS team at FOSS4G in Seoul, Korea in September 2015, the Committee 
has mainly worked on the UN Open GIS Initiative, a project “...to identify and develop an Open Source GIS bundle that meets the requirements 
of UN operations, taking full advantage of the expertise of mission partners including partner nations, technology contributing countries, 
international organisations, academia, NGOs, private sector. The strategic approach shall be developed with best and shared principles, 
standards and ownership in a prioritized manner that addresses capability gaps and needs without duplicating efforts of other Member States 
or entities. The UN Open GIS Initiative strategy shall collaboratively and cooperatively develop, validate, assess, migrate and implement sound 
technical capabilities with all the appropriate documentation and training that in the end provides a united effort to improve the effectiveness 
and efficiency of utilizing Open Source GIS around the world.”
